You are a senior full-stack developer and financial data engineer.

Generate a complete, production-ready HTML file (single page, no backend) that displays
hourly reports of stock price changes for S&P 500 companies.

Requirements:

1. Data Source
- Use a public stock market API (e.g. Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Finnhub, Yahoo Finance via proxy).
- Abstract the API key as a placeholder variable.
- Fetch data for S&P 500 symbols (use a static list or a representative subset if API limits apply).

2. Functionality
- Fetch stock prices once per hour automatically using JavaScript (setInterval).
- On page load, perform an immediate fetch.
- Compare the current price to the previous hour’s price.
- Calculate:
  - Absolute change
  - Percentage change

3. UI / HTML
- Pure HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- Display data in a responsive table with columns:
  - Ticker
  - Company Name
  - Last Price
  - Change ($)
  - Change (%)
  - Last Updated (time)
- Use color coding:
  - Green for positive change
  - Red for negative change
  - Gray for no change

4. Reporting
- Display a timestamped “Hourly Report” header.
- Highlight top 5 gainers and top 5 losers in separate sections.
- Store previous hour data in browser memory (localStorage).

5. Error Handling
- Gracefully handle API errors or rate limits.
- Display a user-friendly error message.

6. Code Quality
- Well-commented code.
- Clear separation between data fetching, processing, and rendering.
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+).

7. Output
- Return ONLY the full HTML file (including <style> and <script> blocks).
- Do not include explanations or markdown.
